# Problem-solving

my reference for the material,blogs,websites and practice i did for the interview preparation.

I would include the problems the references i used to solve, blogs i read and want to keep as a good resource to review and the list of you tube channels that are providing great support to students.

I would also love to write my reivew about the strategies one can use to start his jouney and also make a phase wise targets to become an effective programmer.
